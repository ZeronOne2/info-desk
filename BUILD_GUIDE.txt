Info-Desk EXE Builder Guide (Fixed Version)
===========================================

Multiple build methods available to avoid encoding issues:

Method 1: PowerShell (Recommended)
==================================
1. Right-click build_exe.ps1
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Wait for completion
4. Find Info-Desk.exe in dist folder

Method 2: Python Script
======================
1. Double-click build_minimal.bat
   OR
   Run: python build_exe.py
2. Wait for completion
3. Find Info-Desk.exe in dist folder

Method 3: Batch File
===================
1. Double-click build_exe.bat
2. If encoding errors occur, use Method 1 or 2

Build Process:
=============
1. Install packages (PyQt5, openpyxl, pyinstaller)
2. Clean previous builds
3. Run PyInstaller
4. Generate dist/Info-Desk.exe

Result:
======
- Standalone EXE file (~50-60 MB)
- No Python required for end users
- Single file distribution
- Works on Windows 10+

Troubleshooting:
===============
- Encoding errors: Use PowerShell or Python method
- Python not found: Install from python.org
- Build errors: Check error messages
- Large file size: Normal due to PyQt5

Distribution:
============
Just share the Info-Desk.exe file!
Users can run it without any installation.
